A game with falling blocks in different shapes. The goal is to create full lines that will disappear afterwards.

This project was created for self-educational purposes only, not intended to be sold anywhere.

## Engine

The engine is self written in C# / .net Framework using OpenGL or GDI (WinForms) for rendering.

## Important Note

This was originally created in 2015 as part of a larger suite of self-written games by multiple people, called "SSTSS". That whole suite is not published publicly.

Credits to parts of the original engine go to:
* Michael Kurz
* Michael Lechner

Now in 2021 I have only extracted my game from that suite, with major reworks to the game and the engine to not have licensed stuff here.
